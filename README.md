# coinAPItest
###  Title:
Avg price and size of transaction from a live coinAPI.

### Description:
What it does: To grap the averge of price and size from the coin API using the most up to date information.

### How to use:
Just download the app and run `node app.js` in your terminal and you should see the most up to date information in the .data file.

### Technologies and credits:
I used no dependencies.  I have limited exposure to the backend.  One of my first exposures to the backend was a vanilla javascipt course in node.js (https://www.pirple.com/courses/take/the-nodejs-master-class/lessons/3809402-anatomy-of-a-node-application#) that used no dependencies
including no NPM.  So I used the tools that I know of and tools that I looked up, to build this project.  I did recently go through a course for node.js, express, sql commands,
sqlite, and db browser, from (https://www.codeacademy.com) but since I rushed through it in 5 weeks, I really need the full 8 weeks to attempt the projects.

### Challenges faced:
I had never tried to hook up to an foreign API before.  My guidience was the one example from the vanilla javascript course.  Learning to use backend tools and techniques
was a learning experience for me.

### Thinks I hope for future:  
I'm sure there are better ways of writing my code.  I would love for someone to give me feedback on how to refactor this code, but this is my first offical backend project. 
It happens to be for a test.  It may not be the best code, but hopefully I show off my skills that I can complete a project with such little knowledge to begin with. 
Learning how to write better code comes with practice and exposure.  My front end skills are little better polished.
